for a better presenting, I did not create new branch under the calculator repository.

AC is all-clear and reset the screen backto 0;
+/- is negative button, % is percentage but currentlt could only calculate the value divided by 100.

This is how the calculator looks like, all styles from iPhone calculator by ios 12.4.
